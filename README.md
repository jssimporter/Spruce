Huge thanks to Shea Craig, who wrote the bulk of this work and is still providing advice, though not currently involved in Jamf administration.

The world of Mac administration evolves fast, and continued functionality of Spruce and python-jss requires active engagement from the Jamf-using Mac Admin community.
